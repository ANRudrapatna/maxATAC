# Generating training and validation regions of interest from ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq peaks

## Rationale

We want a reproducible method for generating the training and validation regions of interest for each TF model based on the available data. We will use the input meta table as a reference for the peak locations. This file is intended to make ROI for Training, Validation, Model Selection, and Testing
